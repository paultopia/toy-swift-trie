# toy-swift-trie

just a toy project to write a trie for strings in swift.  I actually have a use for this in an app I'm thinking of writing, but I've never written a trie before, so breaking this out here for experimenting/learning and future reference.  (And also [begging the internet for help](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/244010/trie-implementation-for-strings-in-swift).)
